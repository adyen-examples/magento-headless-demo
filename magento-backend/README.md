# Adyen [Magento 2 Plugin](https://docs.adyen.com/plugins/magento-2) integration demo

In this demo, you can spin up a Magento instance and install the [Adyen Payment plugin](https://marketplace.magento.com/adyen-module-payment.html) to see how it works. You can try this demo online in one click using Gitpod (a remote IDE) or locally on your computer using Docker.

## Running online with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

1. Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
2. 
 - Go to [gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables)
 - Set the `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` variables (Scope: `adyen-examples/*`).
 - Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the Gitpod account variables as well. These will be used as your login credentials in the Magento admin dashboard. (Scope: `adyen-examples/*`).
 > __Note__ `ADMIN_PASSWORD` must contain alphanumeric characters (Magento requirement).   
 
3. Click the button below and **wait ~260s (4 minutes)** (for the Magento installation). You should have `magento2-container  | Starting periodic command scheduler: cron.` before proceeding to next step.

4. Open a new Terminal in the current directory and run `./install.sh` to install and configure the Adyen payment plugin.
5. Visit your shop on the generated preview URL
6. Visit `previewURL/admin/` and login to see that the Magento Plugin is installed correctly.
Login using the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you created in step 2 above.
7. You can see the GitPod account variables which are automatically set in **Step 2** above, visit `Stores` → `Configuration` → `Sales (submenu)` → `Payment Methods` → `Other Payment Methods` → `Adyen Payments` → `Required Settings`.

_NOTE: To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, you have to add `https://*.gitpod.io` as allowed origin for your chosen set of [API Credentials](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/api_credentials_new.shtml)._
